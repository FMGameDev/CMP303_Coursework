// Game State Manager
// The function of Game State Manager is manage all the game states (splash, menus, levels, credits, etc), create them, delete them switch to other game state,
// It has a collection with game states, a shared context, etc

//		I have used it as reference how to create this class for the following methods and components:  
//			- switchTo(), addToRemoveContainer(), processRequests(), createState(...), removeState(...), RegisterState(...)
//			- sharedContext, stateContainer, gStateToRemove and stateFactory.
//		Some parts of them have been modifed to adapt the solution to my game, removing some parts as activate/desactivate state, 
//      the shared context is also used the different way.
