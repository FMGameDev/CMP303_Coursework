// Shared Context
// it is an unique file 
// Shared Context contains two structures with all the pointers to the objects which are necessary in all the game (every game states)
// This pointers will be pointing to the objects which must be declared in some static class which will be active during all the game
// In this case these objects has been created in the main.cpp
