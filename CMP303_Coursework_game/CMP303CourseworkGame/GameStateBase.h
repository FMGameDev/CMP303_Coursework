// Game State Base
// All of the game states will extend of Game state Base
// This class has mainly all the game basic functions (handleInput, update and render), a label, gameStateMgr object
// also it has a window, audio manager and input component which is obtained from the sharedContext of GameStateManager (just to keep clean and minimize the code)
